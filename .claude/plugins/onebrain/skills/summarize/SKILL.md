# Summarize

Fetch a URL and create a structured summary note in your resources folder.

Usage: `/summarize [url]`

---


## Step 1: Get the URL

If provided after the command, use it directly.

If not, ask:
> What URL do you want to summarize?

---

## Step 2: Check Bookmarks

Grep `[resources_folder]/Bookmarks.md` for the URL. If found, note it silently : you will offer to remove it after the summary note is saved (Step 7).

---

## Step 3: Ask for Context

Optional but helpful : ask:
> Why are you saving this? (e.g., research for a project, reference for later, interesting read)

This context shapes how the summary is framed.

---

## Step 4: Fetch and Read

Fetch the URL content. If it fails:
> I couldn't fetch that URL. You can paste the content directly and I'll summarize it.

Read the full page content.

---

## Step 5: Extract Key Information

Identify:

- **Title** of the article/page
- **Author** and publication date (if available)
- **Core thesis or main point**
- **Key arguments or findings** (3-7 points)
- **Memorable quotes** (1-3 if applicable)
- **Actionable takeaways** (if any)
- **Content type**: article, documentation, paper, blog post, video transcript, etc.

---

## Step 6: Choose Subfolder and Save

**Resolve subfolder:**

1. Glob existing subfolders in `[resources_folder]/*/`
2. Suggest a kebab-case subfolder based on the article's topic (max 2 levels, e.g. `productivity/tools`)
3. Present to user: "I'd file this under `[resources_folder]/[suggested-path]/`. OK?"
4. Use confirmed path for file creation.

**Create the summary note** at `[resources_folder]/[subfolder]/[Article Title].md`:

```markdown
---
tags: [summary, topic-tag]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
source: /summarize
url: [URL]
author: [Author Name]
published: [Publication date if known]
---

# [Article Title]

> **Source:** [URL]
> **Saved:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Why I saved this:** [User's context, if provided]

## Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of the main point]

## Key Points

- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

## Notable Quotes

> "[Quote]"
> : [Author/Source]

## Related

[[Link to related vault notes]]
```

---

## Step 7: Suggest Links and Clean Up Bookmark

**Suggest links:** Search for related vault notes (use the search tools if available, otherwise Glob `[resources_folder]/**/*.md` and `[knowledge_folder]/**/*.md`).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📄 Summary — {Title}
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saved to `[resources_folder]/[subfolder]/[Title].md`

Related:
  • "{Note 1}" — {reason}
  • "{Note 2}" — {reason}
(omit "Related" block if no related notes found)

→ Add links? (say yes to link them)
→ Run /learn to save key insights to memory.

**Update bookmark with wikilink:** If the URL was found in `Bookmarks.md` in Step 2, append a wikilink to the existing bookmark entry so it points to the new summary note:

Find the line in `Bookmarks.md` containing the URL and append ` → [[Article Title]]` to it:

```markdown
- **[Name](URL)** : Description. → [[Article Title]]
```

Refresh `updated` in the Bookmarks.md frontmatter. Do this silently : no confirmation needed.

**Clean up bookmark:** After adding the wikilink, show:

🔖 Linked `Bookmarks.md` → [[{Title}]].

Then AskUserQuestion:
- question: "Remove the bookmark entry now that you have a full summary note?"
- header: "Bookmark Cleanup"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - label: "Remove", description: "Delete the bookmark entry — you have a full summary note now"
  - label: "Keep both", description: "Keep the bookmark and the summary note"

If the user selects "Remove", remove the bookmark entry from `Bookmarks.md` and refresh `updated` in its frontmatter.

## Known Gotchas

- **Paywalled articles fetch successfully but return only the teaser.** If the fetched content is unusually short for an article (< 300 words) but the page is known to be long-form, tell the user: "This page may be paywalled — I only got the preview. Paste the full content and I'll summarize it."

- **JavaScript-rendered pages may return near-empty content.** Single-page apps and some Substack posts render content client-side. Retry once; if the content is still too sparse to summarize meaningfully, offer the paste fallback from Step 4.

- **Steps 2 and 7 both read `Bookmarks.md`.** If the file is large, read it once early (Step 2) and reuse the content in Step 7 rather than grepping twice. The file does not change between these steps.

- **Wikilink append format in Bookmarks.md.** The ` → [[Title]]` appended in Step 7 must use the exact note title as it appears in the vault, not the article title from the web (they may differ by punctuation or casing). Use the filename stem of the note that was just created.
