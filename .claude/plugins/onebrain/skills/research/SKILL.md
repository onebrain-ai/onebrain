Use when the user wants to investigate a topic from scratch with no specific URL — 'research X for me', 'what do I need to know about Y'. Do NOT use for: processing a specific URL the user already has (use summarize), processing a book already read (use reading-notes), or quick note capture without web research (use capture or braindump)."

# Research

Research a topic and save the findings as a structured note in your resources folder.

Usage: `/research [topic]`

---

## Step 1: Clarify the Research Goal

If topic is provided, confirm scope. If not, ask:
> What do you want to research?

Then ask:
> What are you trying to figure out? (This helps me focus the research.)

Optional: ask depth preference:
- **Overview** : broad understanding, key points
- **Deep dive** : comprehensive, with sources and nuance
- **Practical** : focused on how-to and actionable takeaways

---

## Step 2: Conduct Research

Search for information on the topic. Look for:
- Authoritative sources (docs, papers, established publications)
- Multiple perspectives if the topic is contested
- Practical examples or case studies
- Recent developments (note dates of sources)

---

## Step 3: Synthesize

Before writing the note, synthesize what you found:
- What's the core answer to the user's question?
- What are the key concepts to understand?
- What's actionable or immediately useful?
- What's uncertain or contested?

---

## Step 4: Choose Subfolder

1. Glob existing subfolders in `[resources_folder]/*/`
2. Suggest a kebab-case subfolder based on the research topic (max 2 levels, e.g. `technology/ai`)
3. Present to user: "I'd file this under `[resources_folder]/[suggested-path]/`. OK?"
   Show existing subfolders as options.
4. Use confirmed path for file creation.

---

## Step 5: Create Research Note

File: `[resources_folder]/[subfolder]/[Topic Name].md` (subfolder confirmed in Step 4)

If a note on this topic already exists (search recursively in `[resources_folder]/**/*.md`), ask whether to create a new one or append a "Research : [Date]" section.

```markdown

tags: [research, topic-tag]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
source: /research
sources: [list of key sources]

# [Topic Name]

> **Research goal:** [What the user was trying to figure out]

## Overview

[2-3 sentence summary]

## Key Concepts

### [Concept 1]
[Explanation]

### [Concept 2]
[Explanation]

## Key Takeaways

- [Actionable insight 1]
- [Actionable insight 2]
- [Actionable insight 3]

## Open Questions

- [Something the research didn't fully resolve]

## Sources

- [Source 1 : title and context]
- [Source 2 : title and context]

## Related

[[Link to related vault notes]]
```

---

## Step 6: Suggest Follow-Up

After creating the note:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔍 Research — {topic}
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saved to `[resources_folder]/[subfolder]/[Topic Name].md`

You might also explore:
  • {related topic 1}
  • {related topic 2}
(omit "You might also explore" block if no follow-up suggestions)

→ Run /summarize [url] to go deeper on a specific source.
→ Run /learn to save key insights to memory.

## Progress reporting

This skill is long-running. Emit a 1-line status update after each major step so the user can see progress in real time.

**In-session format:**

```
→ [step N/M] <action being taken>
```

**Examples:**

```
→ [step 1/6] fetching seed sources...
→ [step 2/6] expanding queries via qmd...
→ [step 3/6] reading 12 web sources...
→ [step 4/6] extracting key claims + cross-referencing...
→ [step 5/6] drafting resource note...
→ [step 6/6] saving to 04-resources/ + adding links...
```

**Rules:**
- Emit one line per major step (NOT per sub-step or tool call)
- M = total steps known up front (count them before starting)
- Status lines use `→ [step N/M]` prefix exactly so they're visually distinct from skill output
- Do NOT emit heartbeats for fast operations (< 5 seconds)

---

## Known Gotchas

- **Versioned tools and libraries.** Web search may return cached or outdated documentation pages. Include the version number in search queries when the topic is a versioned library or framework, and note the publication date of each source in the note.

- **No web search tool in context.** If no search tool is available, be explicit about which parts of the research come from training data vs. live sources. Do not silently present training knowledge as web-researched findings.
