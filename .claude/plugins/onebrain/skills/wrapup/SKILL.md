# Session Summary (TL;DR)

Generates a summary of this session and saves it to the logs folder for future recall.

---

## Scope

/wrapup writes the session log only. It does NOT promote insights to memory/ — that is
/recap's responsibility. Do not write to MEMORY.md or memory/ files.

---

## Session Log Frontmatter

See `skills/startup/references/session-formats.md` → Session Log Format for frontmatter variants and body sections. **Never add `recapped:` or `topics:`** — those are populated by /recap later.

---

## Step 0: Active Pause Thread Detection

Run this BEFORE Step 1.

1. Read `[logs_folder]/pause/_active.md`. If absent or empty → set `wrapup_mode = "session"`; skip to Step 1 (zero-overhead path for non-pause sessions).
2. If a slug is present: parse the file's single-line content as `slug`. Glob `[logs_folder]/pause/*-{slug}-pause-*.md` → `pause_count` (file count) and derive `first_date` = earliest `YYYY-MM-DD` date prefix among matched files (used in Step 3's question text).
3. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

   Question: "Active pause thread: `{slug}` ({pause_count} snapshots since {first_date}). Wrap up this thread now?"
   Options:
   - "Yes — consolidate into one session log" (sets `wrapup_mode = "thread"`)
   - "No — wrapup today's work only; keep pause thread active" (sets `wrapup_mode = "session"`)

4. If `wrapup_mode = "session"` AND active pause exists → fall through to **Step 0b: Auto-Finalize Pause** (below) BEFORE proceeding to Step 1.
5. If `wrapup_mode = "thread"` → proceed to Step 1 normally, then branch in Step 4 (see Step 4 modifications below).

---

## Step 0b: Auto-Finalize Pause (Session-mode wrapup with active thread)

Runs only when `wrapup_mode = "session"` AND `_active.md` exists.

Apply the three skip conditions from `skills/pause/SKILL.md` → Auto-Finalize section:

1. **No-activity:** if no checkpoint file exists for current `session_token`, skip Auto-Finalize.
2. **Already-captured-this-session:** if latest pause file's frontmatter `session_token` matches current AND no checkpoint mtime > pause file mtime, skip.
3. **No-pause-files-and-untouched:** if no pause file exists for slug AND newest checkpoint mtime < `_active.md` mtime, skip.

If not skipped: invoke `/pause` auto-finalize path (Steps 2–5 of `/pause`, with `trigger: auto-finalize` in frontmatter and "Auto-finalized at session end. " prefix in `## Where I Stopped`).

After Step 0b, continue to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Gather Checkpoint Context

1. Get today's date as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Extract `YYYY` and `MM`.
2. Use `session_token` from context if already loaded (set by `onebrain session init` at startup); if absent, run `onebrain session init --json` and use the `SESSION_TOKEN` value.
3. Glob checkpoint files (post-v2.4.0: checkpoints live in flat `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/` regardless of date):
   - **Match on the token, with NO date filter:** `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/*-{session_token}-checkpoint-*.md`

   > **Why no date filter.** A date-bounded glob (today + yesterday) silently strands the checkpoints of a
   > session that has run three days or more: Step 1 does not see them because they are too old, and
   > Step 1b cannot see them because it **excludes the current token by design**. Neither path reads them
   > into a log and neither deletes them, so they sit in `checkpoint/` forever, invisible from both sides.
   > The directory is ephemeral and every file in it carries its owning token in the filename, so matching
   > on the token alone is both sufficient and complete — and the cross-midnight case then needs no special
   > handling at all.
4. If any found: **read every file** and extract its content. Every checkpoint must be fully incorporated during the review in Step 3 and reflected in the log written in Step 4 : not just used as background context. Checkpoints capture activity that may have been compressed out of current context; missing any of them means losing that history.
5. Store the list of found checkpoint paths for use in Step 5. **Only paths that were read and incorporated go on this list.**

If none found: continue normally.

> **Note on cleanup:** Checkpoints are deleted (not annotated) after the session log is successfully written. Any checkpoint file that still exists is unmerged by definition; no `merged:` filter is needed.

---

## Step 1b: Orphan Recovery Scan

After Step 1, scan for unmerged checkpoints belonging to **other** sessions (orphans).

**Variable scope (used throughout this step):** Initialize two lists at the top of Step 1b and keep them alive until Step 7 reads them at the end of /wrapup:
- `skipped_active = []` — `{path, age_minutes, reason}` records, where `reason` ∈ `{"active", "age_unknown", "concurrent_during_recovery", "delete_failed", "already_recovered", "marker_write_failed"}`. Both the *Active-Session Guard* and *Auto-Recover Each Orphan Group* append to this list. **When adding a new value to this enum, also add a corresponding row to the `{reason_summary}` rendering table in Step 7** (search this file for `{reason_summary}` rendering); unmapped values render via the catch-all fallback row but the user-facing string is generic, so an explicit row is required for new values.
- `orphaned_recovered_logs = []` — paths of recovered session logs left on disk by an aborted recovery. Two abort sources feed this list: (1) **concurrency abort** in step (g) when the owning session writes a new checkpoint mid-recovery and the recovered-log delete itself also fails; (2) **marker re-read failure** in step (f) when the recovery marker is missing from the just-written log (LLM omission, partial write, encoding glitch). Both produce a recovered log without a deleted checkpoint group; the user must manually reconcile. Listed in its own Step 7 block (these are not checkpoint files, so they don't fit the checkpoint-file heading).

### Scan Scope

Glob `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/*-checkpoint-*.md` (flat — post-v2.4.0 all checkpoints live in one directory regardless of date). No date filter: `checkpoint/` is ephemeral (cleaned by /wrapup after each session), so any file surfacing here is either an active cross-harness session (caught by the Active-Session Guard below) or a real orphan that needs recovery.

### Identify Orphans

From all found checkpoint files:
1. Parse session_token from each filename: the alphanumeric segment between the date and the literal word "checkpoint" in pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-{session_token}-checkpoint-NN.md`. If empty, apply Legacy token handling (see below) rather than skipping.
2. Exclude files where the parsed session_token exactly equals the current session token (those belong to the current session, already handled in Step 1). Do not use substring/contains matching — only exact equality.
3. Group remaining files by their parsed session_token. **Store the file list of each group as `group_files`** (the baseline used by step (g)'s concurrency re-glob below); never re-derive the group fresh later in this step.

**Legacy token handling:** If the parsed segment is a 6-character random string (pre-v1.10.4 format), still include the file in orphan recovery. Group these files under a synthetic key `legacy-{segment}` and process them the same way as regular groups. This ensures migration from v1.10.3 and earlier does not lose checkpoints. Note each legacy file in the Step 7 report as a warning.

If no orphan groups found: skip to Step 2.

### Active-Session Guard (Time Window)

> **Why this guard exists:** A non-current token does NOT mean the session is dead. When two harnesses (e.g. Claude + Gemini) run in the same vault, each sees the other's in-flight checkpoints as "non-current token". Without this guard, the first /wrapup to run would auto-recover the other harness's *active* checkpoints into a fake session log and delete the originals — silently corrupting the live session. Token != mine ≠ session is dead.

For each orphan group from the *Identify Orphans* step above, decide between **recover** and **skip-active** by file age (the `skipped_active` list was initialized at the top of Step 1b):

1. **Resolve the threshold once** (before scanning groups): read `onebrain.yml`'s `checkpoint.minutes` (defaults to 30 when the key is absent) and compute `threshold_minutes = max(60, 2 * checkpoint.minutes)`. Examples: default 30 → 60, raised 60 → 120, raised 90 → 180. If `onebrain.yml` is missing, malformed, or `checkpoint.minutes` is non-positive/non-numeric, fall back to `threshold_minutes = 60` — the recovery flow is critical-path; never block on a config issue.
2. Compute `now_epoch` once: `now_epoch=$(date +%s)`.
3. For every checkpoint file in the group, get its mtime as **epoch seconds**:
   - macOS / BSD: `stat -f '%m' <file>`
   - Linux / GNU: `stat -c '%Y' <file>`
   - Take the maximum across all files in the group as `group_newest_mtime`.
4. Compute `age_minutes = (now_epoch - group_newest_mtime) / 60` (integer division is fine).
5. **Fail-safe — destructive default is forbidden.** If any of the following is true, mark the group as **skip-active** (do NOT recover):
   - any stat call failed (file vanished mid-walk, EACCES, NFS error, etc.)
   - `group_newest_mtime` is empty / unparseable
   - `age_minutes` is negative (clock skew, future mtime)
   When ambiguity is detected, append every file path in the group to `skipped_active` as `{path, age_minutes: -1, reason: "age_unknown"}` and continue with the next group. Never fall through to recover when age cannot be determined.
6. **If `age_minutes < threshold_minutes`** — the group is still being written to recently. Treat it as **owned by another live session**:
   - For each file in the group, append `{path, age_minutes, reason: "active"}` to `skipped_active`.
   - Take **NO other action on these files anywhere in this skill** — not in Auto-Recover, not in Step 5 (Checkpoint Cleanup), not in any cleanup later.
   - Continue with the next group.
7. **If `age_minutes >= threshold_minutes`** — the group looks dead: fall through to **Auto-Recover Each Orphan Group** below for this group only.

The threshold gives the owning session a buffer of two full checkpoint windows (the auto-checkpoint hook fires every `checkpoint.messages` messages or `checkpoint.minutes` minutes). A group whose newest checkpoint is older than that has missed at least two windows — a strong "session dead" signal. The `max(60, 2 * checkpoint.minutes)` policy preserves the PR #156 baseline (60 min) for default-config users while scaling proportionally for users who raised `checkpoint.minutes`. **Be precise about which false-positive is safe — they are not symmetrical.** Judging a *dead* group *active* is harmless: nothing is read, written or deleted, and the owning user's next /wrapup consumes the still-on-disk checkpoints normally. Judging a *live but idle* group *dead* is **not** harmless — it falls through to Auto-Recover, which reads those checkpoints, writes them into a session log belonging to a different session, and **deletes them** (step g). No content is lost, but it is relocated: the owning session then wraps up and finds nothing, so its own log is missing the stretch that was taken. That is what `checkpoint.minutes` is really trading against — raise it if sessions in this vault routinely idle for long stretches.

> **Symmetry with `onebrain checkpoint orphans`:** the CLI applies the identical `max(60, 2 * checkpoint.minutes)` rule (in `onebrain-ai/onebrain-cli` → `crates/onebrain-fs/src/orphan/`, `is_group_active_or_ambiguous`) so the startup banner and the recovery skill agree on what is and isn't an orphan. If you change this policy in one place, change it in the other.

### Auto-Recover Each Orphan Group

**Progress signal**: if there are more than 3 orphan groups to recover, emit a one-line progress signal between groups so the user knows the skill is making progress: `Recovering orphan group {n}/{N} ({date})…`. Skip the signal when N ≤ 3 (recovery is fast enough that the signal would be noise).

For each orphan group (process in chronological order by date in filename):

**a. Already-recovered short-circuit.** Before reading checkpoint files, glob `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-*.md` for the group's date (using the orphan date's YYYY/MM). For each match, search the file for the standardised recovery marker. The marker is `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` where `{token}` is the orphan group's session token and `{date}` is the group's date.

> **Anchored match required (security):** match the marker **only when it appears at the start of a line** — i.e., either the literal string `\n<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` or the file beginning with `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->`. A bare substring match would false-positive on session logs whose body quotes the marker as documentation (e.g., a meta-note about how the recovery flow works). The destructive consequence of a false-positive is checkpoint deletion based on a documentation quote — not acceptable. Use `rg -n -F` with `--multiline` and a `(?m)^` anchor, or grep the file line-by-line. **Strip trailing `\r` from each line before the `startswith` check** — Windows-edited logs use CRLF endings; without this the line literal `<!-- recovery-of: ... -->\r` won't match the bare prefix and a legitimate already-recovered marker is silently missed. After CRLF strip, check `line.startswith('<!-- recovery-of: ')` followed by a token/date check.

> **🔴 A marker alone is NOT sufficient to delete. The marker proves that A recovery happened for this
> `token:date` — it does NOT prove that THESE checkpoint files are preserved.** A session that keeps
> running after its checkpoints were recovered writes *more* checkpoints under the same token and the same
> date, and a marker-only check false-positives on every one of them. Deleting on that basis destroys
> history that exists nowhere else. (Observed 2026-07-21: `2026-07-20-session-04.md` was written at 16:38

> none of whose content appears in that log. A marker-only short-circuit would have deleted an entire
> epic's history.) So the short-circuit is gated on **how far the recovery actually got**, not on the
> marker's mere existence.

**The marker carries the boundary.** Its full form is
`<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date}:through-NN -->`, where `NN` is the **highest checkpoint number** that
recovery consumed (zero-padded, matching the `-checkpoint-NN` in the filenames). Step (e) writes it.

> **Why the checkpoint number and NOT a timestamp.** An earlier version of this rule compared each

> mtime *forward*, which silently reclassifies un-recovered checkpoints as preserved and **deletes them** —

> assigned once, and nothing rewrites it.

**If one or more anchored matches are found**, resolve `recovered_through` = the **highest** `NN` across
*all* logs carrying this `token:date` marker (a token+date may legitimately be recovered more than once;
the furthest recovery is what bounds preservation). Parse each checkpoint's own `NN` from its filename and
partition `group_files`:

- **`preserved` — `NN` ≤ `recovered_through`.** Their content is in a prior recovered log. For each,
  append `{path, age_minutes: <original group age>, reason: "already_recovered"}` to `skipped_active`,
  then attempt to delete. Per-file delete failures record `delete_failed` and continue, identical to
  step (g)'s rule.
- **`unpreserved` — `NN` > `recovered_through`.** The owning session wrote these *after* the recovery, so
  no log contains them. **Never delete these on the strength of the marker.** If `unpreserved` is empty,
  continue with the next group — do not proceed to step (b). If it is non-empty, **set
  `recover_files = unpreserved` and fall through to step (b)** to recover exactly those into a new session
  log, leaving the already-preserved ones out of it so the vault gains no duplicate content.

**Legacy markers (no `:through-NN`).** Logs written before this rule carry the bare
`<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` and state no boundary. **Do not guess one, and do not fall back to
mtime.** Treat the whole group as `unpreserved` and recover it. The cost is one duplicated log, once —
step (g) then deletes the group, so this cannot recur or accumulate. Duplication is an inconvenience;
deletion is unrecoverable.

> ⚠️ **Set `recover_files`, do NOT overwrite `group_files`.** `group_files` stays the full group as
> captured in *Identify Orphans* step 3, because step (g)'s concurrency guard diffs a fresh re-glob
> against it: narrowing `group_files` would make the still-present `preserved` files look like paths that
> appeared mid-recovery and would abort every partial recovery with a false `concurrent_during_recovery`.
> Steps (b) and (e) read `recover_files`; step (g) keeps using `group_files` for both the concurrency diff
> and the delete sweep. **When this step does not run (the ordinary case — no marker found),
> `recover_files` defaults to `group_files`.**

**Fail-safe.** If `recovered_through` cannot be determined, or any checkpoint's own `NN` cannot be parsed
from its filename, or any comparison is ambiguous, treat the **whole group as `unpreserved`**: delete
nothing, set `recover_files = group_files`, and fall through to step (b). Duplicated content is an
inconvenience; a deleted checkpoint is unrecoverable, so ambiguity must always resolve toward keeping the
file.

> **Why marker, not frontmatter:** the marker names the specific `token:date` pair recovered, which frontmatter doesn't. A multi-group recovery log can therefore short-circuit per group rather than as a whole, and the marker is harness-/version-independent (frontmatter keys have drifted across releases). See `skills/startup/references/session-formats.md` → *Recovered from checkpoints* for the canonical marker spec.

**b. Read all checkpoint files** in **`recover_files`** (which equals `group_files` unless step (a)
narrowed it to the checkpoints written after a prior recovery). Extract content from each.

**c. Determine the session date** from the filename (`YYYY-MM-DD` prefix of the files in `recover_files`). If they have different date prefixes (cross-midnight session), use the earliest date.

> **A repeat marker for the same `token:date` is expected, not a defect.** When step (a) narrowed the
> group, the log written in step (e) carries the *same* `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` marker as
> the earlier one, but with a **higher `NN`**. That is correct and load-bearing: it raises
> `recovered_through`, so the next /wrapup measures against this recovery rather than the older one. Do not
> "deduplicate" these markers.

**d. Determine the session file name** for that date:
   - List files in `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/` matching `YYYY-MM-DD-session-*.md` (using the orphan date's YYYY/MM)
   - Next session number = count of matches + 1 (zero-padded to 2 digits)
   - Verify the slot is free; increment NN until free

**e. Write the recovered session log** at `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`. Create the directory `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/` (using the orphan date's YYYY/MM) if it does not already exist. Use the Session Log Format from `skills/startup/references/session-formats.md` (case: **Recovered from checkpoints**) — this includes the required `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date}:through-NN -->` body marker as the first body line, where **`NN` is the highest checkpoint number in `recover_files`**. That number is what step (a) reads on the next run to decide which checkpoints are already preserved, so **a marker written without it forces the next /wrapup to re-recover the whole group.** The marker must appear once per group recovered into this log; if a single recovery pass aggregates multiple groups (rare — date-grouping usually yields one group per date), emit one marker line per group on consecutive lines before the `# Session Summary` heading. Apply the **Preservation rule** from Step 4 below: deduplication only, no summarization. Every unique decision, action item, open question, learning, and topic from every checkpoint **in `recover_files`** must appear in the recovered session log.

> **If step (a) narrowed the group, say so in the log body.** Add a short blockquote under the heading
> naming the earlier recovered log, the mtime boundary used, and which checkpoint numbers this one covers.
> A reader who later finds two logs for one `token:date` needs to know they are consecutive slices rather
> than duplicates — and the note is also the evidence that the narrowing was deliberate.

**f. Verify the session log** exists and is non-empty before continuing. **Marker re-read check (required):** re-read the file from disk and confirm the `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date}:through-NN -->` marker line is present at the start of a line, before the `# Session Summary :` heading — **and that its `NN` equals the highest checkpoint number in `recover_files`.** A marker whose `NN` is absent or wrong is as dangerous as no marker at all: too low re-recovers work already saved (harmless duplication), too high tells the next run that checkpoints nothing preserved are safe to delete. Treat an absent or mismatched `NN` exactly like a missing marker below. If the marker is missing (LLM omission, partial write, encoding glitch), the next /wrapup's already-recovered short-circuit will fail to detect this log and could re-recover the same checkpoints into a duplicate session log. To prevent that destructive path, treat a missing-marker as **abort recovery for this group**: do NOT proceed to step (g) (no delete), append the session log path to `orphaned_recovered_logs`, and for each file in `group_files` append `{path, age_minutes, reason: "marker_write_failed"}` to `skipped_active`. The user sees both blocks in Step 7 and can investigate the recovered log + the still-present checkpoints together.

**g. Delete checkpoint files** for this group after confirming step f succeeded.

   - **Pre-delete re-stat (concurrency guard) — runs ONCE before any deletes:** re-stat every file in `group_files` (stored in *Identify Orphans* step 3) AND re-glob the group's filename pattern (`YYYY-MM-DD-{token}-checkpoint-*.md`) under `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/` (flat). The owning session became active during recovery if **either** of these holds:
       - any file's mtime has changed since the Active-Session Guard's stat above, OR
       - the re-glob result contains a path NOT present in `group_files` (set difference: `re_glob_files \ group_files` is non-empty).
   - **If concurrent activity is detected:** **abort the delete entirely for this group.** Then attempt to delete the recovered session log written in step (e) so it does not leak duplicate content into the vault. For each file in `group_files`, append `{path, age_minutes, reason: "concurrent_during_recovery"}` to `skipped_active` (use the original `age_minutes` from the Active-Session Guard). If the recovered-log delete itself fails, append the recovered-log path to `orphaned_recovered_logs` (a separate list initialized at the top of Step 1b) so the user sees it under its own Step 7 block — these are session-log files, not checkpoint files, and conflate poorly with the checkpoint-file heading. Continue with the next group.
   - **If no concurrent activity:** delete each file in `group_files`. **Per-file failure rule:** if an individual `rm` fails (EACCES, NFS hiccup, etc.), do NOT abort the whole group — append `{path, age_minutes, reason: "delete_failed"}` to `skipped_active` (reuse the original `age_minutes` from the Active-Session Guard, never `0`) and continue with the next file. The recovered session log is already written; the next /wrapup's already-recovered short-circuit (step a) will detect that the orphaned checkpoint's content is already persisted and clean it up.
   - **Stage discipline (do not conflate the two rules above):** the concurrency check runs ONCE at the top of step (g). After it passes, individual `rm` failures are NEVER interpreted as concurrency — they record `delete_failed` per-file and the loop continues. Do not re-run the concurrency check between per-file deletes; do not promote a per-file `delete_failed` to `concurrent_during_recovery`. The only group-level abort path is the pre-delete concurrency check.
   - Guard: only delete AFTER step f is confirmed AND the re-stat shows no concurrent activity. Never delete before.

**h. Track recovered sessions:** append `{date} → session-NN.md ({C} checkpoints)` to a `recovered_sessions` list for the final report, where `{C}` is the number of checkpoint files recovered for this group.

---

## Step 2: Determine Session File Name

1. Using the date from Step 1, extract `YYYY`, `MM` (zero-padded month), and `DD` (zero-padded day).
2. List files in `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/` matching **`YYYY-MM-DD-session-*.md`** — use today's actual date as a literal prefix (e.g. `2026-04-25-session-*.md`), not as a wildcard. Only count sessions from today.
3. The next session number = count of matches + 1 (zero-padded to 2 digits: 01, 02, etc.)
4. Verify `YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` does not already exist before writing; if it does, increment NN until a free slot is found.
5. File name: `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`

---

## Step 3: Review the Session

Reflect on the conversation that just occurred. Identify:

- **Main topic(s)** : What did we work on?
- **Key decisions made** : Any choices, directions, or conclusions reached
- **Insights or learnings** : New understanding, patterns noticed, things discovered
- **What worked / didn't work** : Approaches or tools that helped, and anything that slowed us down or failed (omit if nothing notable)
- **Action items** : Tasks to do, things to follow up on
- **Open questions** : Unresolved questions or things to investigate

---

## Step 4: Write the Session Log

**Branch on wrapup_mode (set in Step 0):**

- If `wrapup_mode = "session"` → follow the existing flow below (no changes).
- If `wrapup_mode = "thread"` → use the **Thread Wrapup Branch** below instead of the existing flow:

### Thread Wrapup Branch

1. Glob `[logs_folder]/pause/*-{slug}-pause-*.md` → read every file in chronological order (date prefix ascending, then NN ascending). Store as `pause_files`. Also derive `first_date` = date prefix of `pause_files[0]` and `last_date` = date prefix of `pause_files[-1]` (used in Step 7 confirm).
2. Combine `pause_files` content + checkpoint content from Step 1 (today's session). Apply the Preservation rule (deduplication only, no summarization) across all of them.
3. Determine session file name per existing Step 2 logic.
4. Write `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` using the **Thread wrapup — pause snapshots incorporated** frontmatter case from `skills/startup/references/session-formats.md`:
   ```yaml
   ---
   tags: [session-log]
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   session_token: <token>
   session: NN
   synthesized_from_pause: true
   pause_slug: <slug>
   ---
   ```
5. Body: merged content from step 2, using the Shared Body Sections.
6. After successful write, run `onebrain checkpoint reset`.
7. Proceed to Step 4b (action item routing) and onward as normal.

After Thread Wrapup writes the session log, the existing Step 5 (Checkpoint Cleanup) still runs — checkpoints from Step 1 are deleted. **Plus, in the new Step 5b (below), pause files and `_active.md` are deleted.**

---

> **Preservation rule (critical when checkpoints exist):** the session log must preserve **every unique detail** from every checkpoint file read in Step 1. Your job is **deduplication, not summarization**. Two pieces of content are duplicates only if they describe the same fact, decision, learning, action item, or question. When in doubt, keep both — the session log is the long-term archive of the session, and missing a unique decision or insight cannot be recovered later.
>
> Specifically:
> - **Key Decisions, Action Items, Open Questions** — list every unique entry as its own bullet. Do not collapse multiple decisions into a single line. Do not paraphrase away specificity (file paths, numbers, named constraints).
> - **What We Worked On** — every distinct topic from any checkpoint must appear. Order chronologically. Two checkpoints touching the same topic can be merged into one paragraph; two checkpoints on different topics must remain two paragraphs.
> - **Insights & Learnings, What Worked / Didn't Work** — preserve all unique items. If a learning appears verbatim in two checkpoints, list it once. If two checkpoints have *related but distinct* learnings (e.g., "X works on macOS" + "X breaks on Windows"), keep both.
> - **No length cap** — the session log can be long if the session was substantive. Do not truncate or omit content to hit a perceived target length.
>
> Quality heuristic: the session log's combined length of Key Decisions + Action Items + Open Questions should be at least as long as the sum of those sections across all checkpoints. If your draft is shorter, you've lost detail — go back and add the missing items.

Create `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` using the Session Log Format from `skills/startup/references/session-formats.md`:
- If checkpoints were incorporated in Step 1 → use **Standard /wrapup — checkpoints incorporated**
- Otherwise → use **Standard /wrapup — no checkpoints incorporated**

After writing the session log, reset the checkpoint hook counter to prevent spurious post-wrapup checkpoints:

```bash
onebrain checkpoint reset
```

This writes `0:<epoch>:00` into the session state file (3 fields: count, last_ts, last_stop_nn) — triggering a 60-second skip window and resetting the message counter so the next Stop hook starts fresh.

## Step 4b: Route Action Items to Project Notes

After the session log is written, automatically move action items to the appropriate project note so the startup task scan picks them up.

Store `routed_tasks = []` and `skipped_tasks = []` for use in Step 7.

**4b-1. Extract tasks.** Parse the `## Action Items` section of the session log just written. Collect all lines matching `- [ ] ...`. If none, skip this step entirely.

**4b-2. Discover project notes.** Glob `[projects_folder]/**/*.md`. For each file, collect the folder name (first path segment under `[projects_folder]`) and the filename stem as candidate keywords.

**4b-3. Score and group tasks by target.**

Store `skipped_score0 = []` and `skipped_ties = []` alongside `skipped_tasks` for internal tracking.

For each task line:
  - Score each candidate project note: split the folder name and filename stem on hyphens and underscores to produce individual keyword tokens, then count how many tokens appear as case-insensitive whole-word matches in the task text.
  - Select the highest-scoring candidate. **Require score ≥ 1 and a unique winner (no tie at the top score)** to route.
  - If score = 0 → add to `skipped_score0` and `skipped_tasks`; leave task in session log only.
  - If two or more files tie at the top score → add to `skipped_ties` and `skipped_tasks`; leave task in session log only.
  - Otherwise → assign the task to the winning project note.

**4b-3b. Session-context fallback for score-0 tasks.**

If `skipped_score0` is non-empty, resolve a session context project:
  - Parse the `## What We Worked On` section of the session log.
  - Tokenize the section text (split on spaces, hyphens, underscores, commas).
  - Score each project note candidate using the same token-match algorithm as 4b-3.
  - If a unique winner exists (score ≥ 1, no tie) → that is the `context_project`.
  - For each task in `skipped_score0`: remove it from `skipped_tasks` and assign it to `context_project`.
  - If `## What We Worked On` is absent or produces no unique `context_project` → these tasks stay in `skipped_tasks`.
  - Tasks in `skipped_ties` are never candidates for the fallback — they remain in `skipped_tasks`.

Group all assigned tasks by their target file path. This avoids repeated reads and writes to the same note.

**4b-4. Write each target file once.**

For each target file with one or more assigned tasks:
  - Read the file once.
  - For each task assigned to this file:
    - **Dedup check:** strip the trailing `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` suffix from both the candidate task and all existing task lines (lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [x]`) before comparing. If a task with the same text (open or completed) already exists in the file, skip this task; add to `skipped_tasks`.
    - **Insertion point (priority order):**
      1. Find an existing `## Action Items` section — append after the last `- [ ]` line in it, or after the heading if the section is empty.
      2. If no `## Action Items` section: insert one before `## Open Questions` if present, otherwise before `## Related`, otherwise at the end of the file. Add a blank line before and after the new heading.
    - Collect all non-skipped tasks for this file.
  - If no non-skipped tasks remain after dedup, skip the write entirely for this file.
  - Otherwise write the updated file once. On write error, move all non-deduped tasks for this file to `skipped_tasks` and continue.
  - Store the vault-relative path (e.g. `01-projects/onebrain/OneBrain.md`) as `relative_path`. Append each successfully inserted task as `{task_text, relative_path}` to `routed_tasks`.

**4b-5. This step must never fail /wrapup.** All errors (read/write failures, no project notes found) are silently handled per task or per file. The session log is always the source of truth.

---

## Step 5: Checkpoint Cleanup

After the session log from Step 4 is written successfully, delete every checkpoint file path stored in Step 1.

Guard: only delete AFTER confirming the session log write succeeded. Never delete before or during write. If an individual delete fails, skip it silently — stale checkpoints are cleaned up later by /doctor or by the next /wrapup.

> **Why direct delete (no `merged:` annotation):** A successfully written session log is itself the proof that the checkpoint content is preserved. Annotating the checkpoint with `merged: true` and then deleting it adds a write step that can fail and provides no recovery benefit — if the session log write succeeds, the checkpoint is safe to delete; if it fails, we never reach this step.

---

## Step 5b: Pause Cleanup (Thread Wrapup only)

Runs only when `wrapup_mode = "thread"`.

After the session log from Step 4 (Thread Wrapup Branch) is written successfully:

1. Delete every file in `pause_files` from Step 4 Thread Wrapup Branch step 1.
2. Delete `[logs_folder]/pause/_active.md`.

Guard: only delete AFTER confirming the session log write succeeded. If an individual delete fails, skip silently — `/doctor` will catch stragglers.

---

## Step 6: Recap Reminder

At the end of every /wrapup, compute `unrecapped_count` and `last_recapped`:

**Fast path:** read `stats.last_recap` from `onebrain.yml` if available.
**Glob session logs only:** match the `*-session-*.md` file pattern under
`[logs_folder]/session/` (post-v2.4.0: session logs live in their own
subfolder). Use `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/*-session-*.md` over the
last 6 months and check the `recapped:` field on each. The `-session-`
infix filter is no longer strictly required since `session/` only contains
session logs, but keep it as a defense-in-depth for any non-session
artifact a future version might place there.

Compute:
- `unrecapped_count` — number of session logs without `recapped:` field
  (always ≥ 1 after /wrapup runs — the log just written has no `recapped:` yet)
- `last_recapped` — most recent `recapped:` date found (absent = never)

Display based on condition:
- unrecapped 1–3, last recap ≤ 7 days ago:
    💾 {N} session logs not yet recapped (last: YYYY-MM-DD)
- unrecapped > 3 OR last recap > 7 days ago:
    ⚠️ {N} session logs not yet recapped — last recap: YYYY-MM-DD
- never recapped:
    ⚠️ {N} session logs not yet recapped — never recapped

---

## Step 7: Confirm

Say:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💾 Session Saved
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`

I logged {N} action items.
(omit this line if no action items)

Routed {R} action item(s) to project notes:
  → [task text] → `01-projects/…/Note.md`
(omit this block if routed_tasks is empty; list one line per routed task, using the vault-relative path stored in routed_tasks)

Skipped routing (no match / tie):
  · [task text]
(omit this block if skipped_tasks is empty; list one line per skipped task)

**If `wrapup_mode = "thread"`:** replace the standard header with:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💾 Thread Wrapped Up — `{slug}`
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`

Consolidated {P} pause snapshots from {first_date} to {last_date} + {C} checkpoint(s) from today.
```

Where `{P}` is `len(pause_files)`, `{C}` is the checkpoint count from Step 1. Then continue with action-item routing summary, orphan recovery summary, recap reminder as normal.

**If `wrapup_mode = "session"` AND Step 0b Auto-Finalize ran (not skipped):** add a line after `💾 Session Saved`:

```
📂 Auto-finalized pause thread `{slug}` (snapshot {NN}). Thread still active — /resume to continue.
```

**If `wrapup_mode = "session"` AND Step 0b Auto-Finalize was skipped due to skip-condition (1, 2, or 3):** add a line after `💾 Session Saved`:

```
📂 Pause thread `{slug}` still active ({pause_count} snapshots) — /resume to continue.
```

Auto-recovered {S} orphan session(s):
  {YYYY-MM-DD} → `session-NN.md` ({C} checkpoints)
(omit this block if none recovered)

Skipped {A} checkpoint file(s) ({reason_summary}):
  · `YYYY-MM-DD-{token}-checkpoint-NN.md` (age: {age_minutes}m, reason: {reason})
(**Required output — do NOT omit when skipped_active is non-empty.** This block is the user's only signal that checkpoint files were intentionally left on disk. `{A}` is the file count, equal to `len(skipped_active)`. List one line per `{path, age_minutes, reason}` record. Render `age_minutes` as a non-negative integer; if `-1` (sentinel), render as `age: unknown`. Render `reason` verbatim from the record. If `{A}` > 5, list the first 5 and add a final line `· (+{A-5} more)`. Omit this block ONLY when `skipped_active` is empty.

**`{reason_summary}` rendering — use the table below VERBATIM, do not paraphrase. Enum values are defined at the top of Step 1b alongside `skipped_active`; if you add a new value there, add its row here too:**
  - all records have `reason: "active"` → `another harness still running`
  - all records have `reason: "age_unknown"` → `age could not be determined`
  - all records have `reason: "concurrent_during_recovery"` → `owning session became active mid-recovery`
  - all records have `reason: "delete_failed"` → `checkpoint delete failed`
  - all records have `reason: "already_recovered"` → `already preserved in a prior recovered log`
  - all records have `reason: "marker_write_failed"` → `recovered log saved but recovery-of marker missing — see "Resolving marker_write_failed" below`
  - multiple distinct reasons → `mixed: ` + comma-joined sorted unique reason values (e.g. `mixed: active, delete_failed`)
  - **fallback (catch-all):** all records share a single `reason` value not listed above → `skipped (reason: {reason})` — render the raw enum value verbatim. This row exists to prevent silent rendering drift when a new `reason` value is added to the enum without a matching table entry; the surface signal is generic on purpose so a missing row is visible to the user (and prompts a contributor to add the proper mapping above).

Orphaned recovered log(s) needing manual cleanup ({L}):
  · `session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`
(**Required output — do NOT omit when orphaned_recovered_logs is non-empty.** These are session-log files written by an aborted recovery — either (a) the owning session became active mid-recovery and the cleanup delete of the recovered log itself also failed (`concurrent_during_recovery`), or (b) the post-write marker re-read found the `<!-- recovery-of: ... -->` marker missing (`marker_write_failed`). In both cases the file persisted but its checkpoint group was NOT deleted. Cross-reference with the `Skipped {A} checkpoint file(s)` block above to identify which group each entry belongs to and the actionable fix per `reason`. `{L}` is `len(orphaned_recovered_logs)`. List one line per path. Omit this block ONLY when `orphaned_recovered_logs` is empty.)

Good session! See you next time.

### Resolving `marker_write_failed`

Render this subsection in the Step 7 report **only when the report contains a `marker_write_failed` record**. The text is a numbered list (more robust against LLM paraphrase pressure than long single-liners) and disambiguates token sourcing — date is in the recovered-log filename, token is in the still-present checkpoint filenames in the `Skipped {A} checkpoint file(s)` block.

> A `marker_write_failed` record means a recovered session log exists on disk but is missing its `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` marker line. Without intervention, every subsequent /wrapup will re-recover the same checkpoints and grow this list. Pick **one** of the following — both are correct and final:
>
> 1. **Repair in place.** Open the recovered log path listed in `Orphaned recovered log(s) needing manual cleanup` and add `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` as the very first body line, before the `# Session Summary :` heading. Source `{date}` from the recovered-log filename's date prefix; source `{token}` from the still-present checkpoint filenames in the `Skipped {A} checkpoint file(s)` block above (pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-{token}-checkpoint-NN.md`).
>
> 2. **Discard and let the next /wrapup re-recover.** Delete BOTH the recovered log AND its associated checkpoint files together. Next /wrapup's orphan recovery will re-process the checkpoints from scratch; the (hopefully) successful re-write will include the marker. Only choose this when you trust the next recovery to capture the same content.

## In-Skill Examples

**Good Key Decisions section** (enough detail to reconstruct what happened):
```markdown
## Key Decisions

- Chose $PPID as session token because it is stable within a shell session and unique per terminal window
- Delete checkpoints directly after the session log write succeeds — the written log is the recovery proof, no `merged:` annotation needed
- Kept the state-file reset bash snippet in Step 4 rather than a hook, to avoid hook-ordering issues
```

**Bad Key Decisions section** (too vague to be useful later):
```markdown
## Key Decisions

- Fixed a bug
- Made some changes to wrapup
- Updated the session handling
```

## Known Gotchas

- **Orphan checkpoints from a different token.** Rare case: if the vault was used before CLI v2.0.10 (which fixed the token mismatch between `session-init` and the stop hook), checkpoint files may exist under a different token than the current session. If Step 1 finds no checkpoints but you expect some, look for date-matching checkpoint files in the folder with any token and offer to synthesize them manually.

- **Cross-month midnight sessions (post-v2.4.0).** Checkpoints live flat in `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/`, so cross-midnight wrapup is now driven entirely by date prefix in the filename — no folder math required. Step 1's yesterday-glob simply decrements the date by one day (with month/year rollover for the literal date in the filename) and globs the same flat directory. The previous `YYYY_PREV/MM_PREV` folder math is no longer applicable.

- **Pre-v2.2.0 checkpoint files with `merged:` field.** Older vaults may contain checkpoint files that have a `merged: false` or `merged: true` frontmatter field from earlier wrapup runs. The new flow ignores this field entirely — any checkpoint file that exists at /wrapup time is treated as unmerged, regardless of the field's value. The 14-day-old check in /doctor catches any stragglers regardless of the field.

- **Duplicate session slot collision.** If auto-save and a manual /wrapup run nearly simultaneously, both may try to write `session-01.md`. Step 2 already verifies the slot is free before writing — do not skip this check even when synthesizing from checkpoints.
