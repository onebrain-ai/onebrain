# Session File Formats

Shared canonical templates. Referenced by:
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — stop checkpoint writes
- `skills/wrapup/SKILL.md` — /wrapup session log (Step 4) + orphan recovery (Step 1b)
- `skills/startup/AUTO-SUMMARY.md` — auto-saved session log

**Never add `recapped:` or `topics:` to any session log frontmatter** — these fields are set exclusively by /recap. Writing them here causes /recap to silently skip the log.

## Shared Body Sections

Both checkpoint files and session log files use these sections in order:

```markdown
## What We Worked On

[see per-format note below]

## Key Decisions

- [bullet list of decisions made]

## Insights & Learnings

- [new understanding, patterns, discoveries — omit section if none]

## What Worked / Didn't Work

- ✅ [something that worked]
- ❌ [something that didn't — omit section if no notable friction]

## Action Items

- [ ] [task] 📅 YYYY-MM-DD

## Open Questions

- [unresolved questions]
```

---

## Checkpoint Format

Written by the Stop hook. Keep under 250 words total.

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
tags: [checkpoint, session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
checkpoint: NN
trigger: stop
---
```

`session_token` is the same token embedded in the filename — duplicating it in frontmatter lets `/wrapup`, `/doctor`, and `checkpoint orphans` filter checkpoints by token without parsing filenames. The agent (per `INSTRUCTIONS.md` Auto Checkpoint section) sets this from the `session_token` already in context (recovered via `onebrain session init` if missing).

**Body:** use Shared Body Sections above. `## What We Worked On`: 2-3 sentences describing the session focus.

**Dataview compatibility:** Never write `` `=… `` (backtick followed by `=`) anywhere in the file — Dataview parses it as an inline query and throws a parse error in Obsidian. Use `→` in place of `==>`, or describe the concept in plain prose instead of quoting it in a code span.

---

## Pause File Format

Written by `/pause` (user-driven snapshot) or auto-finalize before AUTO-SUMMARY / `/wrapup` "n" branch when an active pause thread exists. Filename pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}-pause-NN.md` (NN scoped to slug across all dates, not reset per day).

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
tags: [pause, session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
task_slug: <kebab-case-slug>
pause: NN
trigger: manual
---
```

- `trigger: manual` — written by `/pause` (default)
- `trigger: auto-finalize` — written automatically before session end when `_active.md` exists and skip conditions don't apply (see `skills/pause/SKILL.md` §Auto-Finalize)

`task_slug` and `pause` mirror the filename so frontmatter-only filters work without parsing filenames.

**Body:** use Shared Body Sections above, PLUS two additional sections at the top:

```markdown
## Where I Stopped

1–2 sentences describing the current state of the work: file being edited, decision pending, last test run.

## Resume With

One concrete action to perform first on resume — specific file path, command, or decision point.

## What We Worked On

[checkpoint section]

## Key Decisions

[bullet list]

## Insights & Learnings

[omit if none]

## Action Items

- [ ] task 📅 YYYY-MM-DD

## Open Questions

[bullet list]
```

**Word cap:** 350 words total (100 more than checkpoint, to accommodate Where I Stopped + Resume With).

**Dataview compatibility:** same rule as Checkpoint Format — never write `` `=… `` anywhere in the file.

---

## Session Log Format

**Header line** (before body sections):
```markdown
# Session Summary : [Month DD, YYYY] (Session N)
```

**Body:** use Shared Body Sections above. `## What We Worked On`: 1-3 sentences describing the session's focus.

### Frontmatter by Case

Use the complete block for the matching case. Do not mix fields from different cases.

**Standard /wrapup — no checkpoints incorporated:**
```yaml
---
tags: [session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
session: NN
---
```

**Standard /wrapup — checkpoints incorporated:**
```yaml
---
tags: [session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
session: NN
synthesized_from_checkpoints: true
---
```

**Auto-saved (auto-summary) — no checkpoints:**
```yaml
---
tags: [session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
session: NN
auto-saved: true
---
```

**Auto-saved (auto-summary) — checkpoints incorporated:**
```yaml
---
tags: [session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
session: NN
auto-saved: true
synthesized_from_checkpoints: true
---
```

**Recovered from checkpoints** (used by: /wrapup orphan recovery for prior sessions whose checkpoints were never wrapped up):
```yaml
---
tags: [session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
session: NN
synthesized_from_checkpoints: true
auto-recovered: true
---
```

**Thread wrapup — pause snapshots incorporated** (used by: `/wrapup` Thread Wrapup Branch when user confirms `y` on the active-thread prompt):
```yaml
---
tags: [session-log]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
session_token: <token>
session: NN
synthesized_from_pause: true
pause_slug: <kebab-case-slug>
---
```

`pause_slug` records which thread this log consolidates. Body content merges all pause files of the slug + checkpoint files of the current session into one log, following the Preservation rule from /wrapup Step 4.

`session_token` mirrors the token embedded in the filename so cross-references (orphan recovery's `recovery-of:` marker, /distill source-log filtering, /doctor checks) can match by frontmatter without parsing filenames. Source the token from the `session_token` already in agent context (set by `onebrain session init` at startup); for **Recovered from checkpoints**, source it from the orphan group's parsed token (the same one embedded in the body marker), not the live session's token.

**Body marker (required for this case):** the very first body line — placed before `# Session Summary :` — must be the recovery-of marker:
```markdown
<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{YYYY-MM-DD}:through-NN -->
```

Where `{token}` is the recovered group's session token (parsed from the checkpoint filenames), `{YYYY-MM-DD}` is the recovered session's date (the checkpoint files' date prefix, not today), and **`NN` is the highest checkpoint number this log actually consumed** (zero-padded, matching the `-checkpoint-NN` in the filenames). Emit one marker line per recovered group; if a single recovery pass aggregates multiple groups, write one marker per group on consecutive lines. **The marker must occupy a full line on its own** — do not embed it inline within prose, do not append text after the closing `-->`. The /wrapup `already-recovered` short-circuit anchors its detection to start-of-line so a session log that quotes the marker as documentation in mid-paragraph cannot trigger a false short-circuit.

**Why a body marker, not just frontmatter:** /wrapup's `already-recovered` short-circuit (Step 1b → Auto-Recover step a) needs a stable, version-independent signal that a given group was already preserved in a prior recovered log. Frontmatter shape has drifted across releases (`auto-recovered: true` here, `case: recovered` in older drafts, `synthesized_from_checkpoints: true` shared with manual wrapups). The body marker is the only signal that:
1. Names the specific token + date pair recovered (frontmatter doesn't), so multi-group recovery logs short-circuit per group rather than as a whole,
2. Survives any future frontmatter-key rename without breaking existing recovered logs,
3. Is greppable by a fast `rg`/`grep` before any YAML parse.

> **🔴 `through-NN` is load-bearing, not decorative.** The `{token}:{date}` half proves only that **a**

Recovered logs written by older /wrapup versions (predating the marker, or predating `through-NN`) state no boundary. /wrapup treats them as covering **nothing**, so their group is re-recovered into a duplicate session log — acceptable and self-limiting: the duplicate carries a proper boundary, the group is then deleted, and it cannot recur. The asymmetry is deliberate — omitting the boundary costs one duplicate log, whereas overstating it deletes history that exists nowhere else.
