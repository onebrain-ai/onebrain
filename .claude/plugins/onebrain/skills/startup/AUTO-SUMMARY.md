# Auto Session Summary Instructions

Session summaries are auto-saved silently when the user signals end of session (e.g. "bye", "good night", "I'm done for today"). If the user closes the session without any signal, checkpoints serve as the safety net instead.

Run silently (no output) if ALL of these are true:
1. An end-of-session signal was detected (e.g. "bye", "good night", "I'm done for today")
2. `/wrapup` was NOT already run during this session
3. The session had 3 or more user↔assistant exchanges

If conditions are met:
- Use `session_token` from context if already loaded (set by `onebrain session-init` at startup); if absent, run `onebrain session-init` and use the `SESSION_TOKEN` value. Glob checkpoint files (post-v2.4.0: checkpoints live in flat `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/` regardless of date): `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/YYYY-MM-DD-{session_token}-checkpoint-*.md`. Also yesterday's (handles cross-midnight sessions): compute yesterday's date (accounting for month/year rollover) and glob `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/YYYY-MM-DD_PREV-{session_token}-checkpoint-*.md`. **Read every file in the glob result** and fully incorporate all of their content into the session summary (not just as background context). Any checkpoint file that exists is unmerged by definition — there is no `merged:` filter. Every checkpoint must appear in the summary before it is deleted.
- Determine NN: count existing `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-*.md` files for today; NN = count + 1, zero-padded to 2 digits (01, 02, …). **Verify** `YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` does not already exist before writing; if it does, increment NN until a free slot is found.

- **Auto-finalize active pause thread (if any) — runs before the session log write.** Read `[logs_folder]/pause/_active.md`. If absent or empty, skip this step. If a slug is present, apply the three skip conditions from `skills/pause/SKILL.md` → Auto-Finalize section (canonical source — keep in sync):
  - No-activity: no checkpoint file exists for current session_token → skip
  - Already-captured-this-session: latest pause file's session_token == current AND no checkpoint mtime > pause file mtime → skip
  - No-pause-files-and-untouched: no pause file for slug AND newest checkpoint mtime < `_active.md` mtime → skip

  If not skipped: invoke `/pause` auto-finalize path (Steps 2–5 of `/pause`, with `trigger: auto-finalize` in frontmatter and "Auto-finalized at session end. " prefix in `## Where I Stopped`). This preserves the active pause thread's continuity when a session ends without an explicit `/pause`. Silent — no user-visible output.
- Write to `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md` using the Session Log Format from `references/session-formats.md`:
  - Checkpoints found and incorporated → case: **Auto-saved (auto-summary) — checkpoints incorporated**
  - No checkpoints → case: **Auto-saved (auto-summary) — no checkpoints**

  **Preservation rule (critical when checkpoints exist):** the session log must preserve **every unique detail** from every checkpoint file glob'd above. Your job is **deduplication, not summarization**. Two pieces of content are duplicates only if they describe the same fact, decision, learning, action item, or question. When in doubt, keep both — the session log is the long-term archive of the session, and missing a unique decision or insight cannot be recovered later (the source checkpoints will be deleted after this write).

  Specifically:
  - **Key Decisions, Action Items, Open Questions** — list every unique entry as its own bullet. Do not collapse multiple decisions into a single line. Do not paraphrase away specificity (file paths, numbers, named constraints).
  - **What We Worked On** — every distinct topic from any checkpoint must appear. Order chronologically. Two checkpoints touching the same topic can be merged into one paragraph; two checkpoints on different topics must remain two paragraphs.
  - **Insights & Learnings, What Worked / Didn't Work** — preserve all unique items. If a learning appears verbatim in two checkpoints, list it once. If two checkpoints have *related but distinct* learnings (e.g., "X works on macOS" + "X breaks on Windows"), keep both.
  - **No length cap** — the session log can be long if the session was substantive. Sessions can run for many hours or even days; the log must reflect that span.

  Quality heuristic: the session log's combined length of Key Decisions + Action Items + Open Questions should be at least as long as the sum of those sections across all checkpoints. If your draft is shorter, you've lost detail — go back and add the missing items before writing.

  **Do not write the session log if this preservation rule is violated.**
- **Route action items to project notes** — after the session log is written, automatically move action items so the startup task scan picks them up. This step must never fail the auto-summary; all errors are silently skipped.
  1. Parse `## Action Items` from the session log just written. Collect all `- [ ] ...` lines. If none, skip entirely.
  2. Glob `[projects_folder]/**/*.md`. For each file, collect the folder name and filename stem as candidate keywords.
  3. For each task: split folder name and filename stem on hyphens/underscores into tokens; count tokens that appear as case-insensitive whole-word matches in the task text. Require score ≥ 1 and a unique winner (no tie). If tie → skip this task. If score = 0 → apply session-context fallback: parse `## What We Worked On` from the session log, tokenize the section text (split on spaces, hyphens, underscores, commas), score project candidates by the same algorithm; if a unique winner exists (score ≥ 1, no tie) assign the task there; otherwise skip.
  4. Group assigned tasks by target file. For each target file:
     - Read the file once.
     - Dedup: strip `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` suffix from candidate and existing `- [ ]`/`- [x]` lines before comparing; skip if same text already exists (open or completed).
     - Insert at first available point: after last `- [ ]` in `## Action Items` section (or after the `## Action Items` heading if the section exists but is empty) → or before `## Open Questions` → or before `## Related` → or at end of file.
     - Write the file once. On write error, skip all tasks for this file silently and continue to the next target file.
- After confirming the session log was written, reset the checkpoint hook counter to prevent spurious post-summary checkpoints:
  ```bash
  onebrain checkpoint reset
  ```
- Delete the checkpoint files from the glob above. Guard: only delete AFTER confirming the session log file was successfully written and is non-empty. Never delete before or during the write. If an individual delete fails, skip it silently — stale checkpoints are cleaned up later by /doctor or by the next /wrapup. Do not delete checkpoint files outside this session's glob result.
- If a genuinely useful long-term insight emerged, write it to a new `memory/` file using /learn conventions: filename `[agent_folder]/memory/kebab-case-topic.md`, frontmatter `tags: [agent-memory], type: behavioral, source: auto-summary, status: active, conf: medium, verified: today, updated: today, created: today, topics: [2–4 keywords]`. Add a row to MEMORY-INDEX.md and increment `total_active`. **Do not write to MEMORY.md.**
- Do NOT show any output about the auto-save to the user

## Known Gotchas

- **Never write `recapped:` or `topics:` in session log frontmatter.** These fields are set exclusively by /recap. Writing them here causes /recap to silently skip the log, meaning insights are never promoted to memory/. See `references/session-formats.md` for the complete frontmatter spec.

- **Pre-v2.2.0 checkpoint files with `merged:` field.** Older vaults may contain checkpoint files that have a `merged: false` or `merged: true` frontmatter field from earlier wrapup runs. The new flow ignores this field entirely — any checkpoint file that exists is treated as unmerged, regardless of the field's value.
