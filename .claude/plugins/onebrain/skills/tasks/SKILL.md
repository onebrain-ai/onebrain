# Task Dashboard

Creates or updates a permanent `TASKS.md` at the vault root using Obsidian Tasks plugin live query blocks. The file is always current : no vault scanning needed. Mark tasks complete directly in Obsidian by clicking the checkboxes.

Usage:
- `/tasks` : open the full dashboard

---

## Step 1: Locate vault root

Read `onebrain.yml` from the current working directory. The directory containing `onebrain.yml` is the vault root. If `onebrain.yml` does not exist, warn the user:

> "onebrain.yml not found : using current working directory as vault root: [path]. Run `/onboarding` to set up your vault configuration."

Then proceed with cwd as vault root.

`.claude` is always excluded as a hardcoded literal (not in onebrain.yml) : it is the plugin host directory and is not user-configurable.

---

## Step 2: Ensure TASKS.md exists and frontmatter is current

Determine `tasks_path = {vault_root}/TASKS.md`.

**If TASKS.md does not exist:**

Create it with this exact content (replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date and substitute all five bracket-notation variables : `[logs_folder]`, `[archive_folder]`, `[knowledge_folder]`, `[resources_folder]`, `[agent_folder]` : with their session config values; `.claude` is a hardcoded literal and requires no substitution):

If the write fails, stop immediately and tell the user:

> "Could not create TASKS.md at [tasks_path]. Error: [error]. Check that the vault path is correct and that you have write permission. Vault root used: [vault_root]"

Do not proceed to Step 3 if the write failed.

**If TASKS.md already exists:**

Read the file. Extract `created:` from the frontmatter : if absent, use today's date and tell the user: "`created:` was missing from TASKS.md frontmatter : set to today's date. Edit it manually if you know the original date."

Overwrite the entire file using the same template as above, substituting:
- `created:` with the extracted (or today's) date
- `updated:` with today's date
- All five bracket-notation variables (`[logs_folder]`, `[archive_folder]`, `[knowledge_folder]`, `[resources_folder]`, `[agent_folder]`) with their session config values

If the write fails, stop immediately and tell the user:

> "Could not update TASKS.md at [tasks_path]. Error: [error]. Check that the vault path is correct and that you have write permission. Vault root used: [vault_root]"

Do not proceed to Step 3 if the write failed.

## Step 3: Open in Obsidian and confirm

The shipped helper detects platform and emits the right URI (cygpath, percent-encoding, etc.). On macOS/Linux/MSYS just run it via Bash:

```bash
bash ".claude/plugins/onebrain/startup/scripts/open-in-obsidian.sh" "TASKS.md"
```

In a PowerShell-only environment where `bash` is not on PATH, the helper still runs because Git for Windows / WSL ships `bash.exe` on PATH alongside Obsidian on Windows; if it genuinely is not present, skip the open step (the file is already saved) rather than constructing a URI by hand — manual URI assembly is exactly the pattern the helper exists to replace.

Then say:
📋 TASKS.md updated.
→ Opening in Obsidian...

## Known Gotchas

- **TASKS.md is a query-only dashboard — never add raw tasks directly to it.** The file is overwritten on every `/tasks` run. Any tasks written directly into TASKS.md will be lost on the next run.

- **`path does not include` queries use partial matching.** If a folder name appears as a substring of another (e.g., `resources` appears in `04-resources`), the exclusion still works correctly because Obsidian Tasks matches the full path. But verify exclusions when adding new folders with overlapping names.

- **Obsidian must be open** for the `open obsidian://` command to work. The command fails silently if Obsidian is not running — this is expected behavior, not an error.
