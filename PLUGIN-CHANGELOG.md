# Plugin Changelog

All notable changes to the OneBrain plugin — i.e., any vault-deployed content (Claude plugin under `.claude/plugins/onebrain/`, Gemini config under `.gemini/`, future harness configs).
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

> **Versioning:** Plugin version is tracked in `plugin.json`. Bump when ANY harness config changes — skills, agents, hooks, INSTRUCTIONS, Gemini settings, slash commands, etc.
> For CLI binary (`@onebrain-ai/cli`) changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2.4.7 — 2026-05-12

- 4 new wizard skills: `/schedule-add` (recurring), `/schedule-once` (one-shot), `/schedule-list`, `/schedule-remove` (E9.1)
- 26 user-facing skills declare `schedulable:` / `schedulable_with_args:` frontmatter — gates which skills the CLI scheduler accepts (E9.4)
- `/doctor` extended with Scheduler Health section: scans `.err.md` files, detects drift between `vault.yml` and installed plists, flags 3+ consecutive failures + expired one-shots (E9.2)
- INSTRUCTIONS.md adds "Scheduling — which tool to use" + "Headless invocation" sections (E9.3) — disambiguates OneBrain scheduler vs Claude Code `/loop` and `/schedule`
- `/help` MAINTAIN tier lists the 4 new schedule commands

## 2.4.6 — 2026-05-12

- Remove vault-author-specific references from plugin source for genericity
- /search: drop hardcoded `[projects_folder]/onebrain/plans/*.md` source; replace with generic `[projects_folder]/**/*.md` covering embedded specs/plans/design docs (keeps search coverage for projects with any folder layout)
- /search: replace hardcoded vault folder names with `[knowledge_folder]`/`[projects_folder]`/`[resources_folder]`/`[areas_folder]` placeholders; update progress line + frontmatter description to match
- /clone: replace personal example path with generic `/path/to/source/vault` in audit-log template
- /capture, /consolidate: replace concrete vault-author note paths in routing/moved examples with `[folder]/example/...` placeholders

## 2.4.5 — 2026-05-12

- Hot-fix: enforced English-only across /search per `onebrain-repo-english-only` rule
- Removed non-English auto-invoke triggers; kept 3 English: `search vault`, `find in vault`, `why did`
- Removed non-English example phrases and regex tokens from SKILL.md body + references + INSTRUCTIONS routing description
- Removed premature `schedulable` / `schedulable_with_args` / `required_args` frontmatter (defer to E9 scheduler shipping in a later PR)
- Bilingual user input still routes via agent's intent matching on the English description; non-English literals were redundant

## 2.4.4 — 2026-05-12

- New skill /search — general vault retrieval (E5)
- Answers both what + why questions across MEMORY/memory/sessions/plans/decisions logs/notes
- Uses qmd (lex+vec+hyde) with grep fallback
- Auto-invoke triggers: `search vault`, `find in vault`, `why did` (initial entry shipped with non-English triggers; hot-fixed in 2.4.5)
- Registered under 🔍 RECALL tier in /help

## 2.4.3 — 2026-05-12

- Added `## Progress reporting` section to 6 long-running skills (E3)
- Skills updated: /research, /consolidate, /distill, /reorganize, /connect, /import
- Format: `→ [step N/M] <action>` emitted at each major step
- Trust improvement during multi-step skill runs

## 2.4.2 — 2026-05-12

- /help reorganized into 4 Workflow tiers: 📥 INPUT · ⚙️ PROCESS · 🔍 RECALL · 🔧 MAINTAIN
- /onboarding moved from Maintain → Input (first run only)
- README skill list reordered to mirror tier structure
- Discoverability win for new users; existing users now see skills by phase

## [Unreleased]

## v2.4.1 — fix(qmd, /update): drop stale `--qmd` / `--remove-qmd` flags from docs

CLI dropped both `--qmd` and `--remove-qmd` from `onebrain register-hooks` in v2.1.0 (auto-detects from `vault.yml`'s `qmd_collection` instead — present registers the hook, absent strips it). Three plugin docs still told users and `/update` to pass these flags. On Windows after upgrading to CLI v2.2.1+, both `/update` and `/qmd uninstall` surfaced this as `unknown option` errors from commander.

- fix(skills/qmd/SKILL.md): Step 8 (`/qmd setup`) and Step 4b (`/qmd uninstall`) now run `onebrain register-hooks` (no flag); auto-detects from vault.yml.
- fix(skills/update/references/migration-steps.md): Step 6 merges the qmd-hook bullet into the unconditional `register-hooks` call — no separate `--qmd` invocation.

## v2.4.0 — feat(07-logs): subfolder restructure + per-skill log entries

Restructure `07-logs/` into 4 typed subfolders and add audit log entries for 12 skills. Companion CLI release v2.2.2 updates `orphan-scan` and the Stop hook's NN-counting helper to read from the new flat `checkpoint/` directory.

- feat(07-logs): split into `session/YYYY/MM/`, `checkpoint/` (flat), `update/` (flat), `log/YYYY/MM/`. Mental model: session/checkpoint = NN per run, everything else = append per day.
- feat(/update Step 0): idempotent migration moves files to the new layout (preserve YYYY/MM for session; flatten checkpoint + update). Detect-by-residual-files re-runs cleanly on interrupt.
- feat(startup): legacy structure detection nudges /update with a one-line banner; orphan-scan fallback auto-detects pre- vs post-v2.4.0 layout (multi-vault user safety).
- feat(skills): /recap, /distill, /memory-review, /learn, /consolidate, /connect, /reorganize, /onboarding, /qmd, /clone, /doctor, /weekly each write an audit log to `log/YYYY/MM/`. Shared `_shared/audit-log-format.md` reference deduplicates frontmatter + append-per-day algorithm + run-section heading + failure-mode rules.
- feat(audit-log frontmatter): canonical 3-field schema (`tags: [audit-log, X]`, `skill: /X`, `date: YYYY-MM-DD`) across all skill audit logs; per-skill discriminators (topic, subcommand, mode, path, version). Tag taxonomy unified — `[doctor-log]`, `[update-log]`, `[weekly-review]` flipped to the `[audit-log, X]` umbrella so a single Obsidian `tag:#audit-log` query surfaces every skill run.
- feat(session log + checkpoint frontmatter): `session_token: <token>` added to all 5 Session Log Format cases and the Checkpoint Format. Token previously lived only in checkpoint filenames; cross-referencing a session log to its checkpoints required parsing filenames. Now `rg "session_token: abc12345" 07-logs/` surfaces every artifact for that session.
- feat(/wrapup): orphan recovery reads flat `checkpoint/`, writes to `session/YYYY/MM/`. Cross-midnight handling simplified to filename-date math. Progress signal for N>3 orphan groups. CRLF-safe marker check.
- feat(/doctor): 07-logs structure check (verifies the 4 subfolders); housekeeping warning at >1000 log files. /reorganize now aborts if pre-v2.4.0 structure is detected (run /update first).
- fix(checkpoint-hook.sh + checkpoint.ts): both write to and read from flat `checkpoint/`. Pre-fix, NN counting was reading from legacy `YYYY/MM/` path → every checkpoint after migration would have collided at NN=01.
- fix(/update backup): `[archive_folder]/[agent_folder]/...` instead of hardcoded `05-agent` so users who remapped `folders.agent` see backups land in the matching subfolder.
- fix(migrate.ts runBackfillRecapped): walks `[logs_folder]/session/YYYY/MM/` post-v2.4.0 (was walking `[logs_folder]/YYYY/MM/` and silently skipping all session logs).

## v2.3.4 — docs(instructions): establish 11 iron-rule Working Principles

Promote `## Working Principles` in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` from 4 unnumbered guidelines to 11 numbered iron rules with a precedence-stating intro. These are non-negotiable defaults that apply across every session, every skill, every workflow — and explicitly take precedence over skill-specific instructions when in conflict. Synthesised from a 60+ memory audit, an insights-report friction analysis, and 29 reviewer-passes across 15 distinct role perspectives (writer, designer, student, PM, lawyer, doctor, therapist, teacher, sales, fiction author, financial analyst, journalist, founder, translator, dev) so the language survives universally — neither dev-jargon nor watered-down for technical work.

- docs(INSTRUCTIONS.md): convert `## Working Principles` to numbered list with intro stating these rules outrank skill-specific instructions when they conflict.
- docs(INSTRUCTIONS.md): new rules — *Speak in the user's vocabulary · Verify before asserting · Find the cause, not the symptom · Show a draft before extensive work · Update plan and task status in real time · Don't make the user wait · Update on evidence, not pressure · Carry changes through to related places.*
- docs(INSTRUCTIONS.md): rewrite original 4 rules per cross-role review — drop dev-only references (`AskUserQuestion`, slash-command exception list, "refactor"); merge "Surgical changes" into "Minimal footprint" with cleanup-after-yourself extension; add verifiable-criteria preference to "Define success".
- docs(INSTRUCTIONS.md): each rule body now includes register-matching, root-cause depth, draft-first for structural work, streaming-vs-background nuance, and explicit code-context coverage (callers, tests, types, migrations) — keeping rigor for dev users while staying accessible to writers, students, lawyers, clinicians, and operators.
- docs(INSTRUCTIONS.md): bullet 11 restructured per round-3 cross-role consensus — universal list (other notes, files that reference it, similar cases) leads, dev-specific examples fenced as `(in code: …)` so non-dev readers have a clear visual signal to skim past while dev users keep their precision.

## v2.3.3 — feat(wrapup): PR #156 follow-ups (configurable threshold + recovered-log marker + fallback row)

Three PR #156 follow-ups bundled. CLI track ships matching changes in v2.3.0 (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

- feat(wrapup/SKILL.md): Step 1b resolves `threshold_minutes = max(60, 2 * checkpoint.minutes)` from vault.yml once before scanning groups (was: hard-coded 60). Users who raised `checkpoint.minutes` to 60/90 now get a proportionally larger guard. Missing/malformed vault.yml falls back to 60-min default — recovery is critical-path, never block on config issues. Cross-link to the symmetric CLI helper documents the contract.
- feat(session-formats.md, wrapup/SKILL.md): standardise the `<!-- recovery-of: {token}:{date} -->` body marker for recovered session logs. The `already-recovered` short-circuit (Step 1b → step a) now matches via the marker instead of `case: recovered` frontmatter — version-independent, harness-independent, names the specific token+date pair so multi-group recovery logs short-circuit per group rather than as a whole.
- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): the marker match is **anchored to start-of-line**, not bare substring. A session log that quotes the marker as documentation in mid-paragraph cannot trigger a false short-circuit (which would have destructively deleted checkpoints based on a documentation quote). Spec text in session-formats.md tightened in lockstep.
- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): step (f) now re-reads the recovered session log and verifies the marker survived the write before falling through to step (g)'s checkpoint delete. If the marker is missing (LLM omission / partial write / encoding glitch), recovery aborts for that group: no delete, recovered-log path lands in `orphaned_recovered_logs`, and `skipped_active` records `marker_write_failed` for each file. This converts a silent destructive duplicate into an investigable skip.
- feat(wrapup/SKILL.md): new `marker_write_failed` enum value added to `skipped_active.reason` with its own row in the `{reason_summary}` rendering table.
- feat(wrapup/SKILL.md): `{reason_summary}` rendering table gets a catch-all fallback row for unmapped enum values. The surface signal stays generic so a missing explicit row is visible to the user and prompts contributors to add the proper mapping. Cross-linked to the enum definition at the top of Step 1b so future contributors who add a new `reason` value see both anchors.

## v2.3.2 — refactor(update): delegate CLI bump to `onebrain update`

`/update`'s "CLI Version Check" section was duplicating logic that the `onebrain update` CLI already owns: GitHub release lookup, package-manager detection, install, and binary validation. The skill now defers to the CLI as the single source of truth for the CLI bump.

- refactor(update/SKILL.md): replace 30-line "CLI Version Check" block (raw `npm view` + AskUserQuestion + per-shell bun/npm detection + `npm install -g` / `bun install -g`) with a 3-step delegation: probe `onebrain --version`, run `onebrain update`, surface non-zero exits.
- refactor(update/SKILL.md): drop the npm/bun selection prompt — `onebrain update` already picks `bun` on macOS/Linux and `npm` on Windows; user already consented to `/update` upstream, so a second AskUserQuestion is noise.
- docs(update/SKILL.md): add Known Gotcha — raw `npm install -g` / `bun install -g` calls are reserved for first-time CLI bootstrap (README/install scripts), never `/update`.
- note: pure SKILL.md change, no CLI/binary change. CLI version unchanged at 2.2.0.

## v2.3.1 — fix(wrapup): active-session guard prevents cross-harness checkpoint loss

Wrapup's orphan recovery (Step 1b) auto-recovered any non-current-token checkpoint into a synthesised session log and deleted the originals — including in-flight checkpoints belonging to a *different live harness* in the same vault. Closes the cross-harness contamination path observed when running Claude + Gemini concurrently.

- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): add Active-Session Guard to Step 1b — for each orphan group, stat the newest checkpoint mtime; if `age_minutes < 60`, skip recovery (do not read, do not write a session log, do not delete) and surface in the Step 7 report as `skipped_active`.
- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): explicit fail-safe — any stat error, unparseable mtime, or negative age forces skip-active. Destructive default on ambiguity is forbidden.
- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): pre-delete re-stat in step 1b/f aborts the delete (and removes the just-written recovered log) if the owning session wrote a new checkpoint mid-recovery — closes the read→write→delete race.
- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): exact `stat -f '%m'` (BSD) / `stat -c '%Y'` (GNU) commands spelled out so the LLM doesn't pick the wrong flag silently across platforms.
- fix(wrapup/SKILL.md): Step 7 `skipped_active` block is now MUST-emit (not soft-conditional) and renders `{path, age_minutes}` tuples — the user's only signal that a parallel harness owns checkpoints on disk.
- note: 60-minute threshold gives a buffer of two full auto-checkpoint windows (hook fires every 15 messages or 30 minutes). False-positives (idle but live sessions > 60 min) remain non-destructive — the owning user's next /wrapup consumes its own checkpoints.
- note: pure SKILL.md change, no CLI/binary change. CLI version unchanged at 2.2.0.

## v2.3.0 — feat(gemini): project-level `.gemini/` config alongside `.claude/`

Project-level `.gemini/` config ships alongside the Claude plugin so a single `onebrain init` (or `/update`) sets up both harnesses in the user's vault. Skills, agents, and INSTRUCTIONS stay single-source-of-truth in `.claude/plugins/onebrain/` — both harnesses reference them on demand, no duplication.

- feat(.gemini/settings.json): declarative hooks — `AfterAgent` (matcher `*`) → `onebrain checkpoint stop` (= Claude `Stop` parity); `AfterTool` (matcher `write_file|replace`, regex against Gemini's actual tool names) → `onebrain qmd-reindex` (= Claude `PostToolUse` parity). Both wrapped as `{cmd} > /dev/null 2>&1; echo '{}'` to satisfy Gemini's JSON-on-stdout protocol.
- feat(.gemini/settings.json): `model.disableLoopDetection: true` so legitimate multi-file skill activations (e.g. `/onebrain:help` reading SKILL.md + plugin.json + skills folder) don't trip Gemini's repetitive-tool-call heuristic.
- feat(.gemini/commands/onebrain): 25 hand-curated `.toml` slash commands under the `onebrain:` namespace (`/onebrain:braindump`, `/onebrain:capture`, ...). Namespacing avoids collisions with Gemini built-ins (`/help`, `/tasks`) and mirrors the Claude plugin path. Tab-complete on the suffix works (`/dail<tab>` → `/onebrain:daily`).
- note: this release establishes the unified-plugin policy — anything inside `.claude/plugins/onebrain/` OR `.gemini/` (or future harness configs) bumps the plugin track. CLI track (`package.json`) stays independent for TS source changes only.
- note: distribution — `vault-sync` (CLI v2.2.0+) auto-deploys `.gemini/` to the vault root alongside `.claude/plugins/onebrain/`. No manual install step required.

## v2.2.5 — fix: Windows skill + script compat (PowerShell / cmd / native Python)

Audit pass over every skill snippet that assumed Bash / Unix-only tooling. Closes #128, #129, #130.

- fix(open-in-obsidian.sh): use `cygpath -m` on MINGW/CYGWIN/MSYS to emit `C:/...` paths Obsidian accepts; percent-encode the URI so spaces and `#`/`&`/`?` in vault paths or filenames no longer truncate the launch (#130)
- fix(reading-notes): default filename template uses ` - ` instead of ` : ` so notes save on NTFS without truncation; gotcha note removed (#130)
- fix(import/markitdown-setup): drop the WSL-only gate on Windows; detect `python3` / `python` / `py -3` (and matching `pip` / `py -3 -m pip`) so native Windows installs can install markitdown (#128)
- fix(qmd setup): replace `openssl rand -hex 3` / `python3 -c …` with `node -e "…randomBytes(3)…"`; `basename` swapped for a Node one-liner — Node is portable and already required by the CLI (#128)
- fix(skills): cross-platform shell guidance — `which X || where X` for package detection; describe outcome (mkdir / mv / cp / rm / ls) so the model picks the shell-native form on PowerShell/cmd; drop `"$PWD"` from `onebrain vault-sync` (CLI defaults to cwd) (#129)
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS startup): replace `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -r …` with the Grep tool — UTF-8 handling is platform-correct and PowerShell can dispatch it (#129)
- fix(doctor SKILL): always strip trailing whitespace from vault.yml-derived paths (CRLF on Windows); normalize `installPath` separators before substring checks against the cache dir (#129)
- fix(skills/help, /onboarding, /learn): use `$HOME` / `$env:USERPROFILE` instead of the literal `~` for Glob/Read calls — the Glob tool does not expand tildes (#129)

## v2.2.4 — feat(update): backfill vault-side config drift after migration

- feat(/update SKILL): Step 8 now adds `update_channel: stable` to vault.yml when missing
- feat(/update SKILL): new Step 9 rewrites stale `extraKnownMarketplaces.onebrain.source.repo` (`kengio/onebrain` → `onebrain-ai/onebrain`) in vault `.claude/settings.json`

## v2.2.3 — fix: session-log glob across /wrapup, /daily, /weekly, /distill, /reorganize, INSTRUCTIONS

Same class of bug across multiple skills: globbing `[logs_folder]/.../*.md` matches checkpoint files (`*-checkpoint-*.md`) and `/update` migration logs (`*-update-*.md`) in addition to actual session logs. Tightened every affected pattern to `*-session-*.md` and added an inline note explaining why so it doesn't drift back.

- fix(/wrapup SKILL): Step 6 recap-reminder glob narrowed from `07-logs/YYYY/MM/*.md` to `*-session-*.md`. The bare `*.md` pattern was inflating the displayed unrecapped count (reporting 10 unrecapped when only 2 actual session logs were unrecapped).
- fix(/daily SKILL): Phase 1 "find most recent session log" glob narrowed to `*-session-*.md`. Previously a more recent checkpoint or `/update` log could be picked as "most recent", causing the briefing to read the wrong file.
- fix(/weekly SKILL): Step 1 weekly file list narrowed to `*-session-*.md` so the review doesn't include checkpoint or update logs.
- fix(/distill SKILL): Step 2 session-log search narrowed to `*-session-*.md` so non-session files in the logs folder don't contribute distillation content.
- fix(/reorganize SKILL): flat-root logs glob narrowed from `[logs_folder]/*.md` to `*-session-*.md` so a flat checkpoint or update log isn't treated as a legacy session log to migrate.
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS Recalling Information): Step 3 grep hint now specifies `**/*-session-*.md` so the agent doesn't default to bare `*.md` when searching past decisions.

## v2.2.2 — chore: migrate to onebrain-ai org

- chore(/update SKILL): raw GitHub URL templates updated to `onebrain-ai/onebrain` for plugin file fetches
- chore(plugin.json): version bump aligned with CLI v2.1.7 org migration
- note: existing vaults still work via GitHub auto-redirect; `/update` will pick up new URLs going forward

## v2.2.1 — fix: align with CLI v2.1.6 (Stop-hook-only)

- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): drop entire PostCompact section (Path A/B + auto-wrapup routing). Single dispatch row — `NN since <context>` → write checkpoint. Note added explaining why PostCompact + PreCompact are not registered
- feat(/wrapup + AUTO-SUMMARY): explicit **preservation rule** — deduplicate, don't summarize. Every unique decision, action item, learning, and topic must appear in the session log. No length cap. Heuristic: combined Key Decisions + Action Items + Open Questions length ≥ sum across all checkpoints
- fix(/doctor SKILL): hook check rewritten to allowed-events sweep (Stop + PostToolUse only); sample report shows stale-entry warnings instead of PostCompact-specific failure
- fix(session-formats.md): drop "PostCompact Path A/B" frontmatter case; keep "Recovered from checkpoints" for /wrapup orphan recovery
- fix(/wrapup SKILL.md): state-file note updated to 3-field `0:<epoch>:00`; PostCompact follow-up signal wording removed
- fix(/update migration-steps + SKILL): clarify Stop-hook-only registration; session-end synthesis is via AUTO-SUMMARY or manual /wrapup

## v2.2.0 — fix: PostCompact session log; simplify checkpoint cleanup; stronger qmd-first search

- fix(INSTRUCTIONS PostCompact): inline writes replace background-agent dispatch — Path B silently failed because background agents don't see the main agent's compacted context. Path A still consolidates leftover checkpoints + deletes them, identical to /wrapup.
- fix(wrapup + AUTO-SUMMARY): drop Step 5 (mark `merged: true`) and Step 6 safety-net scan. Checkpoints deleted directly after session log write verified — the log is the recovery proof.
- fix(session-formats): remove `merged: false` from checkpoint frontmatter template.
- fix(doctor): orphan-checkpoint check no longer reads `merged:` frontmatter — any leftover checkpoint is unmerged by definition.
- feat(INSTRUCTIONS + QMD.md): stronger qmd-first guidance — qmd is the explicit default for vault content searches; Grep reserved for non-content lookups.
- chore(memory-health-checks): drop the `merged: true` straggler row; ignore the field on legacy files.

## v2.1.0

- docs(onboarding): update install.sh reference → onebrain init; remove method/runtime.harness from vault.yml template
- docs(skills): remove method: onebrain from qmd and reorganize skill examples
- fix(doctor): --fix removes deprecated vault.yml keys (method, runtime.harness) in addition to onebrain_version

## v2.0.10 — fix: background agent checkpoint writes; updated hook reason format in INSTRUCTIONS

- fix(instructions): Auto Checkpoint routing now parses NN from hook reason; filename built from context session_token
- fix(instructions): stop hook and postcompact writes dispatched to background agent (mode: bypassPermissions) — main session no longer blocks on file writes
- fix(instructions): postcompact uses bare `auto-wrapup` reason; session_token sourced from context with session-init fallback
- fix(instructions): session-init failure explicitly aborts silently; routing table checks auto-wrapup reason first; Path A steps follow Path A dispatch (no longer split by Path B)

## v2.0.9 — fix: startup grep locale, postcompact routing, wrapup score-0 fallback

- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): startup task scan uses `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` prefix on grep — prevents emoji pattern failures on macOS
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): postcompact auto-wrapup Path A (step 9, after verify) and Path B now route action items to project notes — matches /wrapup Step 4b parity
- fix(wrapup): add session-context fallback in Step 4b-3b — score-0 tasks are routed to the project identified from `## What We Worked On` instead of being skipped; separate skipped_score0/skipped_ties lists
- fix(auto-summary): add session-context fallback for score-0 tasks in step 3 with explicit tokenization delimiters — matches /wrapup Step 4b-3b parity

## v2.0.8 — refactor: extract shared session formats; remove backfill-recapped from /update

- refactor(startup): add `skills/startup/references/session-formats.md` — canonical checkpoint + session log templates shared across all writers
- refactor(INSTRUCTIONS): replace inline checkpoint/session log format blocks with reference to session-formats.md
- refactor(wrapup): replace inline session log templates (Step 1b orphan recovery, Step 4) with reference to session-formats.md
- refactor(AUTO-SUMMARY): replace inline format description with reference to session-formats.md
- fix(update): remove migration Step 6 (backfill-recapped) — session logs without recapped: are naturally candidates for /recap, no backfill needed

## v2.0.7 — fix: postcompact Path B, remove PreCompact hook

- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): postcompact auto-wrapup adds Path B — when no checkpoint files exist, synthesize session log from current context (was a no-op, causing auto-compact to write nothing)
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): checkpoint trigger now matches reason prefix — `since start` / `since checkpoint-NN` suffix no longer prevents file creation
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): PreCompact is now a no-op and no longer registered; PostCompact resets counter in all paths
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): remove merged:true write step from postcompact; simplify delete step
- fix(INSTRUCTIONS): update session_token tooltip to include $TMUX_PANE and $TERM_SESSION_ID priority
- fix(doctor): replace PreCompact required-check with stale-hook warning (🟡 suggest /update to remove)
- fix(update): migration-steps.md and SKILL.md updated to reflect Stop/PostCompact-only hook registration
- fix(wrapup): update session token mismatch gotcha note to reflect CLI v2.0.12 fix

## v2.0.6 — fix: replace bash scripts with CLI; fix SessionStart hook breaking vault after /update

- fix(register-hooks): remove SessionStart hook registration — session-init is called by agent startup, not via hook
- fix(wrapup): reset-checkpoint-counter.sh → onebrain checkpoint reset
- fix(update): vault-sync.sh → onebrain vault-sync; backfill-recapped.sh → onebrain migrate backfill-recapped
- fix(update): pin-to-vault.sh + clean-plugin-cache.sh → onebrain vault-sync (doctor, onboarding)
- feat(qmd): register-hooks.sh --qmd/--remove-qmd → onebrain register-hooks --qmd/--remove-qmd
- chore: delete all replaced bash scripts (hooks/, update/scripts/, wrapup/scripts/)
- fix(update): bootstrap step downloads only SKILL.md — no bash scripts needed

## v2.0.5 — fix: vault skill fixes (grep encoding, PostCompact auto-wrapup, /update CLI migration, auto-summary routing)

- fix(startup): task scan grep pattern — replaced `\d` with `[0-9]` for POSIX grep compatibility on macOS
- fix(checkpoint): replace fill-checkpoint PostCompact handler with auto-wrapup — when block reason matches `auto-wrapup: <token>`, recover orphan checkpoints for that token into a session log
- fix(update): Step 7 standard hooks now use onebrain register-hooks CLI; qmd PostToolUse hook still via register-hooks.sh
- feat(update): CLI version check — after vault update, compare installed onebrain CLI against npm latest; prompt to update if newer is available
- feat(auto-summary): add action item routing (Step 4b parity with /wrapup) — after writing session log, route tasks to matching project notes via keyword scoring

## v2.0.4 — feat: /wrapup auto-routes action items to project notes

- feat(wrapup): Step 4b — after writing the session log, extract `- [ ]` action items and route each to the most relevant project note via keyword scoring
- feat(wrapup): dedup guard — skips appending if identical task line already exists in the target file
- feat(wrapup): routing report in Step 8 confirmation — lists each task and its destination note
- feat(wrapup): non-blocking — routing errors are silently skipped per task; session log always written first

## v2.0.1 — fix: /wrapup session numbering

- fix(wrapup): Step 2 glob now requires today's date as a literal prefix — prevents counting all sessions in the month when determining session number for the current day

> **Note:** v2.0.2 and v2.0.3 were CLI-only releases (npm metadata, qmd hook wiring, README). No plugin files changed — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## v1.10.18 — fix: session logs must not include recapped: in frontmatter

- fix(auto-summary): add explicit prohibition against writing `recapped:` or `topics:` in session log frontmatter
- fix(auto-summary): add Known Gotchas section documenting that writing `recapped:` causes /recap to silently skip the log
- fix(wrapup): strengthen `recapped:` prohibition from descriptive to directive with consequence clause

## v1.10.17 — revert onebrain@kengio → onebrain@onebrain

- fix: revert plugin identifier back to onebrain@onebrain (reverts v1.10.12/v1.10.15 rename that broke vault installs)
- fix: rename extraKnownMarketplaces key back to "onebrain" — restores original dev marketplace for repo context
- fix(update): skip extraKnownMarketplaces and onebrain@kengio during settings merge
- fix(onboarding): update install command back to /plugin install onebrain@onebrain

## v1.10.16 — vault-level plugin loading enforcement

- feat(update): add pin-to-vault.sh — pins installed_plugins.json installPath to vault directory
- fix(update): pin-to-vault.sh — fix loop early exit, move plugin.json read outside loop, add empty installPath guard
