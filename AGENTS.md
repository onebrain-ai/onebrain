# OneBrain — Codex CLI

OneBrain is a personal AI OS built on a plain-Markdown vault — use its built-in web UI, or Obsidian if you prefer. INSTRUCTIONS.md is written using Claude Code
tool names — the mapping below translates them to Codex CLI equivalents and explains
how to dispatch sub-agents for skills that require parallel execution.

## Load Order

1. **Tool mapping** — translates Claude Code tool names to Codex CLI equivalents, and maps `Agent` dispatch to `spawn_agent`
2. **Shared agent instructions** — vault structure, skills, session behavior, and personality
